# Intro

Sample application developed to fullfill the requirements of [Camplight's test](https://camplight.notion.site/Test-Task-User-List-Application-06b03dccc2894716bee2df5e99275576).

## Features

- Visit root page to browser users
- Go to `/user/new` to create a new user via the UI (or just click the link in the root page)
- Users can be deleted via the trash icon in the main page
- Users can be filtered by `name` on the main page
- Users basic data can be edited at `/user/{userId}` (link present on the main page)
- Users avatar is attemptively generated by an AI call to the openAI API.

# Tech stack

- Framework: NextJS (TypeScript and App router)
- UI: Tailwind + shadCN
- Database: sqlLite + Prisma (ORM)
- Others: openAI for image generation

# Getting Started

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed (v20.4.0)

Install packages:

```
npm ci
```

Generate the SqlLite database for test purposes

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name initialize
```

Set-up local environment variables by creating a `.env.local` at the root of the project and add a new variable `OPEN_AI_KEY` with your openAI key.

Then run `npx prisma generate`

Start dev server with `npm run dev`

# Next steps

- `sqlLite` was set-up for simple demo purpose, and being able to run everything locally. Scaling would require changing the database to something more
  production ready such as a NoSQL or SQL database
- Avatar images are stored directly in the database, again to be able to run everything locally. To scale - images would idally be uploaded onto a
  static file storage and reference only stored in the database.
- Add testing: unit testing for server actions / utils + e2e testing for user create / edit page + root page
